            <p>Here's a paragraph of delightful nonsense for you:

                The purple elephant danced backwards through the melting clocktower while seventeen spoons argued
                fiercely with a
                philosophical teacup about the proper way to sneeze in B-flat minor. Meanwhile, the Tuesday-flavored
                clouds dripped
                upwards into yesterday's forgotten umbrella, causing all the nearby paperclips to sing operatic arias in
                ancient
                Mesopotamian while juggling invisible oranges that tasted suspiciously of next week's homework. A
                confused giraffe
                wearing polka-dotted socks then announced that gravity had decided to take a vacation, which explained
                why the library
                books were swimming through the air like caffeinated butterflies searching for their misplaced dreams in
                a world where
                mathematics had turned purple and refused to cooperate with basic addition. </p>

            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <p>The bewildered saxophone married a left-handed Wednesday in a ceremony officiated by three confused
                doorknobs who spoke
                fluent mathematics but only on alternate Thursdays when the moon was feeling particularly rectangular.
                Seventeen pickle
                jars spontaneously developed opinions about quantum physics while tap-dancing through a field of
                argumentative shoelaces
                that insisted the color nine was actually spelled with seven silent vowels. A committee of overly
                dramatic paper towels
                held an emergency meeting to discuss why the alphabet had started rearranging itself into geometric
                shapes every time
                someone thought about purple elephants riding bicycles made of crystallized laughter. The local mailbox,
                having recently
                earned a PhD in advanced befuddlement, began delivering letters to clouds while humming the square root
                of jazz music,
                much to the dismay of the neighborhood fire hydrants who had collectively decided to take up
                professional yodeling in
                protest against the tyranny of sensible reality. </p>
